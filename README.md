# AppImage desktop integration

This repository contains a tool that can be used to create a launcher entry by copying a so-called `.desktop` file to the appropriate location.

**Notice:** We recommend the usage of [appimaged](http://discourse.appimage.org/t/new-appimaged-optional-daemon-that-registers-appimages-with-the-system/87) over this tool.
